<p>This is a course project from the University of Michigan's EECS 281 course. This program has two modes: a "Trainer Evasion Mode" (to fight the fewest Pokémon trainers possible and travelling the least distance) and a "Champion Mode" (to catch every Pokémon while minimizing the distance travelled)</p> 
<br>
<p>The prior implements Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm and the latter implements two different algorithms to solve the traveling salesperson problem. </p>
