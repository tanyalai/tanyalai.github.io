<p>Pops Pro Gamer (PPG) Askbot is an in-development, Discord bot for the Michigan Pops Orchestra Discord channel. Currently, server moderators ask a daily question in a channel to facilitate bonding amongst server members. Askbot automates this process and allows for member input.</p>
<br>
<p>Currently, Askbot pulls a question using Google Sheets API v4 from a sheet once a day and asks it in the ask channel. It accepts new questions from users via the !askppg command and adds them to the sheet. The sheet runs a Google Apps Script to filter questions into different sheets by tags.</p>
