<p>This is a VR game built during the 2020-2021 year as part of the <a href="http://medlaunch.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank">MedLaunch Biodesign Challenge</a>. The game was built for stroke rehabilitation patients to stay motivated during their therapy process. There are three picnic-inspired, customizable minigames that target different shoulder and wrist exercises: setting plates and food on a picnic table, wine pouring, and a horseshoes. Each game aimed to maintain a sense of realism with the Unity physics engine, in-game object designs, and co-routines to replicate parallelism of reality.</p>
<br>
<p>My main priorities were on designing and developing the food placement game, environment design, and searching for suitable object designs. Our iterative development and design process involved initial market research and three design reviews with feedback from community partners, Medlaunch peers, and relevant professors. The link in the title is a final video showcase and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tK5Hg_ZKjBF38bpXc3TSNRdpwF5lgBdPZSxUVOuEhG0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this link</a> is to our final showcase slide deck.</p>
