<p>Convertify is a web app, built during the Technica 2020 Hackathon, that takes in any text or article link and converts it to a Lo-Fi audio file. It won "Most Creative Data Hack" sponsored by Splunk.</p>
<br>
<p>Users can also select the number of words they want to include in a search query to acquire the audio file. Once an audio clip was acquired, a script would do audio processing to make it lo-fi. An audio visualizer timed to the music and a virtual keyboard for user interaction then appears.</p>
