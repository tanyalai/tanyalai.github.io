<p>This is a course project from the University of Michigan's EECS 388 course. Using GDB in a Kali Linux Virtual Machine, seven vulnerable C programs were exploited and hijacked using buffer overflow, return to libc, integer overflow, nop slides, buffer over-read, stack shellcode, pointers, and return oriented programming chains.</p>
