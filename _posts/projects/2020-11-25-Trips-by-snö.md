<p>Trips by snö is a final project for EECS 493 (UI Development). It is a prototype of a travel application that helps users organize and save trips that they hope to take with their friends and family. Users can plan our multiple trips, add trip dates, and add various cards with lists, notes, and photos to flesh out further trip details. Currently, all users connected to the app update the same trip instances. Further plans include fixing usability problems discovered through our user study, allowing user login, more fleshed out collaboration functionalities.</p>
