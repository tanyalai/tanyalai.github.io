<p>This project is a suite of three AirBnb inspired web apps: a consumer app for guests, a provider app for hosts, and an admin panel to overview all data stored. The frontend is connected to a MySQL database with an API built with Express.js to perform HTTP request methods. </p>
<br>
<p>Selected features: CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functions to manage user data, booking data, and stay listing data, unique data (ex. personal details, property listings, bookings, etc.) and app views linked to a user's profile, and user authentication for login</p>
<br>
<p>Source code: coming soon. . .</p>
