<p>Feed was designed during Adobe x Netflix's 3 day creative jam. The challenge prompt was to design a website or app "where the community can celebrate shared stories together through communal and authentic experiences."</p>
<br>
<p>Feed is a community-driven, shared, story-telling platform for amateur chefs and home cooks with no culinary experience to share and publish their personal cooking stories and recipes with one goal: to bring everyone to the table. The empathetic and intuitively designed mobile-based application allows for cooks around the world to inspire and empower each other. </p>
