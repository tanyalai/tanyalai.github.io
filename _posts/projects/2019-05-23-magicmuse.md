<p>Magic Muse is a microprocessor-based toy built on the DE2-115 Altera Development board and E100 processor (course specific). It allows users to play different sounds based on their movement within the camera field. Users hold a "magic wand" and can move it around the camera field to interact with 12 sound zones. The active zone which they trigger will then be displayed on the screen and the corresponding noise will be played. This toy also allows users to customize the sounds played by providing 12 .WAV files desired and using a python/bash script that a member of our team wrote.</p>
