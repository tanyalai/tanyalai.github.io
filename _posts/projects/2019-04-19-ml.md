<p>This is a course project from the University of Michigan's EECS 280: Programming and Introductory Data Structures course. The classifier automatically sorts EECS 280 Piazza post datasets into different categories with natural language processing and machine learning. Knowledge involved include recursion, binary trees, templates, comparators, and the map data structure.</p>

<p>The images of code snippets are NOT private code–they are public code results given by the course instructors. The images of the posts are also not private tests–they are also provided in the project spec by the instructors. To view the source code, please email tanyalai@umich.edu to request approval and access.</p>
