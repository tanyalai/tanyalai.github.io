<p>This is a course project from the University of Michigan's EECS 280: Programming and Introductory Data Structures course. The classifier automatically sorts EECS 280 Piazza post datasets into different categories with natural language processing and machine learning. Knowledge involved include recursion, binary trees, templates, comparators, and the map data structure.</p>
