<p>This is a course project from the University of Michigan's EECS 485 (Web Systems) course. Insta485 is a mini-Instagram clone built with React as client-side dynamic pages. Flask was used to build a REST API to be called by the front-end to retrieve post info from the SQLite database. Bash was used to write a script to run the servers and control the database.</p>
