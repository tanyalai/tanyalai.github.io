<p>This is a course project from the University of Michigan's EECS 485 (Web Systems) course. This project is an implementation of a single machine, multi-process, multi-threaded server. The implementation makes use of sockets, threads, and processes to communicate between a main manager and multiple workers, account for fault tolerance and heartbeat messages, and round-robin partition input to complete user-submitted MapReduce tasks. Bash was used to write a script to run the system.</p>
